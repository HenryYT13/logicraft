# A small project I made for a contest
- This is a project that's kind of like SMAS + OLM in Vietnam but all in one. This utilize Supabase Database for storing user data, subject data, and homework for each subject.

# Feature
- Feature List:

# For student:
+ Do homework
+ Background music: Can be turn on or off
+ Feedback to the creator (through discord webhook api)

# For teacher:
+ Add homework
+ Delete homework
+ See students' score
+ Feedback to the creator (through discord webhook api)

# For admin
+ Everything teacher have
+ Add user
+ Delete user

# Feature I want to add but can't
+ Turn it into a website ( I don't have a server + I don't know how to code html, css, js )
+ Add a bigger database for more user and more homework ( I don't have enough money to rent a database in the cloud )
+ Remove the SQL injection inside the code ( Without it, the code will break )

# Final saying
- This project started with me making it local only but now that I started using database, its not only local.
- In the end, I still want to make this project better by redesigning the ui, using a bigger database, and actually code a feedback to teacher and admin page
